Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an experienced software developer with a passion for creating efficient and innovative solutions. Over the past several years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. My primary languages include JavaScript, Python, and Java, and I have significant experience with front-end frameworks such as React and Angular, as well as backend technologies like Node.js and Django.

I am particularly interested in developing scalable web applications and exploring cloud technologies. I have a solid understanding of DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines, using tools like Docker and Kubernetes to streamline development processes. My work emphasizes clean, maintainable code and test-driven development, ensuring that projects remain robust and adaptable to change.
